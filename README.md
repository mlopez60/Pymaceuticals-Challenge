# Pymaceuticals-Challenge
Apply what you've learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.

This challenge tested my knowledge on data visualization in Python. 

My struggle initially was getting the data set up properly so I can successfully visualize the data

Once the data is set up, it is a more or less similar/simple process to display various graphs such as line, pie, bar, scatter, etc. 

I enjoyed this challenge as a key point in data is being able to properly visual what you are trying to discuss. 

Analysis: 
There are 249 unique Mice that were tested, with one mice having a duplicated data point. Due to this, I summarized the data using 248 unique mice.
I calculated a summary stats table to show the mean, meadian, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of tumor volume.
Capomilin and Ramicane had the highest number of observed timepoints.
of the mice population, 51% were male and 49% were female.
From the top 4 performing drugs, Infubinol had an outlier which was excluded.
Capomulin and Ramican had on average lower final tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.
There was a high correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume at 0.84
